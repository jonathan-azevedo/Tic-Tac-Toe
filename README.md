## Welcome!
Thats my first Tic-Tac-Toe game project and also my first programming project ever. I was inspired by Bill Gates' first project, which was also a Tic-Tac-Toe game.<br>
The game is entirely made in Python, and in a future version, it will have a graphic interface.<br>
I hope you enjoy!<br>
### Running Tic-Tac-Toe:

```
git clone https://github.com/jonathan-azevedo/Tic-Tac-Toe.git
cd Tic-Tac-Toe
python main.py
```
